# Bus interface {#sec:bus-interface}

The bus interface of {{processor_name}} is 256 bits wide and supports a subset of CHI Issue B or Issue Eb.
For details about the protocol, please refer to the AMBAÂ® CHI Architecture Specification.

## Supported response types

RespErr of the CHI protocol can indicate a normal response or an error. The response types supported by {{processor_name}} are as follows.

| RespErr value | Response type |
| :---------: | ----------------------- |
| 0b00 | Normal Okay |
| 0b01 | Exclusive Okay |
| 0x11 | Non-data Error, i.e. NDERR |

DERR is not supported because {{processor_name}} does not have a data checksum.

## Behavior under different bus responses

* Normal Okay: Normal transfer access is successful, or exclusive transfer access fails; read transfer exclusive access failure means that the bus does not support exclusive transfer, and an access error exception is generated. Write transfer exclusive access failure only means that the lock grabbing fails and no exception is returned.
* Exclusive Okay: exclusive access is successful.
* NDERR: Access error. Read transfer generates an access error exception, while write transfer ignores this error.

## Interface Signals

CHI uses different channels to transmit different messages, including:

* Data (DAT)
* Request (REQ)
* Response (RSP)
* Listening (SNP)

Channels prefixed with the letters TX are used to send messages, and channels prefixed with the letters RX are used to receive messages.
{{processor_name}} has 6 channels in total:

* RXDAT
* RXRSP
* RXSNP
*TXDAT
*TXREQ
*TXRSP

The signals contained in these channels will be listed later.
In addition to these channels, the bus interface also contains the following signals.

| Signal Name | I/O | Function Description |
| -------------------- | --- | ----------------- |
| chi_rx_linkactiveack | O | Determines the state of RX. |
| chi_rx_linkactivereq | I | Determines the state of RX. |
| chi_tx_linkactiveact | I | Determines the state of TX. |
| chi_tx_linkactivereq | O | Determines the state of TX. |
| chi_rxsactive | I | Indicates that RX has an ongoing transaction. |
| chi_txsactive | O | Indicates that TX has ongoing transactions. |

The linkactiveack and linkactivereq of RX determine the state of RX; the linkactiveack and linkactivereq of TX determine the state of TX.

| status | linkactivatereq | linkactivateack |
|---------- |--------------- |--------------- |
| STOP | 0 | 0 |
| ACTIVATE | 1 | 0 |
| RUN | 1 | 1 |
| DEACTIVATE | 0 | 1 |

### flit format

The bit width is empty, which means that this signal is shared with the signal of the previous row.
A * after the signal name indicates that this signal is only applicable to CHI Issue Eb.
The bit width is followed by an *, which indicates that the signal has different bit widths in CHI Issue B and Issue Eb. The bit width marked with an * is the bit width in Eb.
